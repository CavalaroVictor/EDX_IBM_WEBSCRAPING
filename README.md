Final lessons of the web scraping course: <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+PY0220EN+1T2023/home>Python for Data Science Project </a> with Python promoted by IBM and hosted on EDX.

<a href="https://github.com/CavalaroVictor/EDX_IBM_WEBSCRAPING/blob/main/Final_Assignment_Library.ipynb">Final_Assignment_Library.ipynb</a>, which showcases direct web scraping from Yahoo Finance, with access to the yfinance module. A pip installation workaround was necessary for some modules from the initial lessons of IBM, as they had already been updated.
